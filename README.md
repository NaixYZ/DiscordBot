# Overview

This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. 

(Installation guide soon) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Admin automation (self-role assignment)
- Customisable command permissions
- Ticket System
- Reaction roles
